// Package parse is an address parser built from go-projectusat's vocabularies,
// consulting zipcity where the grammar alone cannot settle a reading.
//
// go-projectusat implements the standard: it tokenizes, every vocabulary says
// what tokens mean, and every address type offers its reading of the whole. All
// of that is exported and composable, so this package assembles those parts
// rather than reimplementing them. What it adds is the step the standard cannot
// specify — choosing among readings that are all grammatically valid — because
// that choice is data dependent and the data lives outside the standard.
//
// The resulting Parser satisfies parser.ParsingFunc, so it drops into
// go-projectusat through AddressParsingOptions.CustomParser.

// street question, folded from up to two zipcity calls into one answer — see
// streetAgreement.
//
// Every answer is evidence, and none of them are symmetric. zipcity answers
// from bloom filters built at a 0.005 false positive rate (the rate is set in
// zipcity's `internal/bloomgenerator`), so a false is definitive — the key was
// never added — while a true is a likelihood ratio of about 200:1 in favour of
// the pairing rather than a confirmation of it. Both move a candidate's score
// by one unit and neither settles it: querying several mutually exclusive
// readings that are all genuinely absent yields a spurious true about
// 1-0.995^k of the time, so a true must not be allowed to resolve a reading
// on its own, and must never be reported to a caller as verification.
//
// A contradiction is likewise not proof the address is wrong. zipcity is built
// from Census TIGER files with documented gaps, so a real address the Census
// missed lands here too. That is why every answer is one point of score
// rather than rejection, and why UseReferenceData is off by default.

// streetAgreement asks zipcity about a reading's street, folding the answer
// — or the two answers, when the reading qualifies for both — into one
// agreement.
//
// ordinarystreet and puertorico are the two types whose StreetName names a
// place. pobox, ruralroute, military and generaldelivery each carry a fixed
// pseudo-name that describes their format rather than a street — "PO BOX",
// "RR 4", "PSC 3" — and zipcity was never built to answer whether those
// strings are streets. Asking it would manufacture a contradiction on every
// closed-form reading rather than evidence about one, so those types are
// left at zip+city alone.
//
// Step 4 of #17 is why puertorico is in that list and not only
// ordinarystreet. The two address types offer readings of the same tokens, so
// where one is asked the street question and the other is not, the answer is
// not evidence about the address — it is a free rung for whichever reading
// happened to be admitted. A17 CALLE 1 / SAN JUAN PR is the measured case:
// both readings hold identical Predirectional, StreetName, StreetSuffix and
// Postdirectional, streetForQuery renders "CALLE 1" for both, and zipcity
// answers that key true. With only ordinarystreet admitted the two readings
// tied on the grammar at rung 3 and the one point went to ordinarystreet
// alone, flipping the reading that reference data off returns. Admitting
// puertorico puts the same question to both, so the point cancels and the
// grammar decides — which is the rule the rest of choose already follows:
// reference data orders readings against each other, it does not get to
// decide which of them may be asked.
//
// An earlier revision of this function did the opposite — skipped the street
// question entirely when the last line put the address in Puerto Rico — on
// the belief that zipcity keys only TIGER's Appendix E short form, so the
// unabbreviated name the spec requires on output could never match. That is
// false against the pinned filter: CheckCityStateAndStreet("SAN JUAN", "PR",
// "CALLE 1") and "CALLE LOIZA" both answer true, and it is "CLL 1" / "CLL
// LOIZA" that answer false. Pub28FeatureName expands featname 156 to CALLE
// and ApplySpanishPrefixOverrides leaves it alone, so the long form is the
// key. A Puerto Rico street is answerable like any other and there is nothing
// here to suppress.
//
// MatchZipAndStreet and MatchCityStateAndStreet are different filters over
// different keys — one shard scoped by ZIP, the other by city and state —
// so their false positives are independent: about 0.005^2 for both to be
// spurious, against 0.005 for either alone. On the truth side the two are
// almost perfectly correlated, since a street TIGER recorded for a ZIP is
// almost always recorded for that ZIP's city too, so a second true adds
// little evidence on its own. What it buys is corroboration: asking both and
// folding the answers before either moves confidence squares the exposure to
// a spurious step instead of doubling it, which is what two separate agrees
// calls would cost. That is why this reading asks both questions whenever it
// has a ZIP, a city, and a two-letter region, and asks whichever one it can
// when it has only one of those — see foldStreetAnswers for the fold.
//
// Each call folds a match into present/absent through presentMatch, which is
// just Found(): an exact hit or a directional-variant hit (DECATUR RD found
// under N DECATUR RD) both count as present, regardless of whether the
// reading itself carries a directional. #34 (addressparsers#6) split on
// hasDirectional instead, on the belief that a variant hit under a reading
// that already carries a directional means TIGER's directional disagrees
// with the input's — a refutation rather than corroboration. #35 found that
// belief false: directionalVariants (zipcity.go) only ever fills whichever
// end, front or back, the reading left empty; it never swaps or drops a
// directional the reading already supplied. So a variant hit can never
// contradict a directional already present — it can only be evidence the
// reading is simply missing one, exactly like the no-directional case. The
// exact-only split also silently starved fully-directional streets (both
// Predirectional and Postdirectional set) of any corroboration at all, since
// there both ends are already filled and Variants is always empty — Found()
// removes that gap along with the false premise. The two-shard fold above
// still applies on top of this; only what counts as "present" in one shard
// changed.
